        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <p>
            The automotive industry is one of the largest industries out there it's a 2.6 trillion dollar industry! India's Automotive Industry is worth more that USD 100 billion and contributes 8% of country's total export. The industry accounts for 2.3% of India's GDP and is set to become the 3rd largest in the world by 2025. The industry consists of many categories and subcategories which are thereby constructed by many variables that it can be said that every category is an industry in itself.
            The challenge in our hand was to prepare a detailed analysis for the automotive industry that aids it in producing the most desirable cars as per the market studies.
            This required a thorough breakdown of the data avaialble to us and constructive lookup for correlations to establish valid conclusions for the market.

         <p>   The dataset used in this report contains cars with their variants with 1200+ model/variants to study over 150+ features. Cleaning of data is done by running a series of python codes for removal of units, irregularities, etc. Mode of the features have been used to fill in empty cells where the data was unavailable.
         The analysis is mainly done on Python using Pandas,Seaborn and various outher libraries and the project uses various queries made in MySQL to figure out relations in data.
        The plotting is primarily done in Jupyter Notebook, Tableau and PowerBI. The Graphical Data Reports are further published using PowerBI for everyone to view.
